# Hi, I'm Marie 👋

Engineering Manager in Data.  
I build reliable data systems — and kind, curious teams.

I believe rigor is what makes data trustworthy,  
and curiosity is what keeps it alive.

## What I care about
- Rigor — in code, docs, and the way we work
- Data that serves a real business need
- Understanding the “why” before the “how”
- Curiosity beyond our own stack
- Questioning decisions as the world evolves

## How I work
- Data is here to help people make better decisions
- Context first, solutions second
- Simple, maintainable systems over clever ones
- Serious about impact, never about ego

## Tools I work with
`SQL` · `Python` · `dbt` · `Grafana` · any data visualization tools

## Outside of work
Running in nature, watercolor painting, music, and traveling 🌿  
I do maths — but I’m human first.
