# Hi, I'm Marie 👋

Engineering Manager in Data.  
I build reliable data systems — and kind, curious teams.

I believe rigor is what makes data trustworthy,  
and curiosity is what keeps it alive.

## ✧ What I care about
◦ Rigor — in code, docs, and the way we work  
◦ Data that serves a real business need  
◦ Understanding the “why” before the “how”  
◦ Curiosity beyond our own stack  
◦ Questioning decisions as the world evolves  

## ❖ How I work
◦ Data is here to help people make better decisions  
◦ Context first, solutions second  
◦ Simple, maintainable systems over clever ones  
◦ Serious about impact, never about ego  

## ✦ Tools I work with
`SQL` · `Python` · `dbt` · `Grafana` · data visualization tools

## ✿ Outside of work
Running in nature, watercolor painting, music, and traveling 🌿  

_I do maths — but I’m human first._
