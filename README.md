### Hey there, I'm Marie ✨

I work in data,  
where trust really matters.

I believe rigor is what makes data trustworthy,  
and curiosity is what keeps it alive.

### 💒 What I care about
Rigor · Curiosity · Critical thinking

### 💻 How I work
- Context first. Solutions second.
- Simple, maintainable systems over clever ones.
- Serious about impact, never about ego.
